# GoSmartCity

## Project Overview
GoSmartCity is a web development project created as part of our Internet Programming course during the 3rd semester of our BSc in Computer Science and Engineering program.
This project was developed collaboratively by Faraz Fardin, Tanbirur Rahman Rocky, and me.

GoSmartCity aims to provide an interactive platform for better urban living by offering features such as real-time traffic updates, housing options, dining recommendations, and easy city navigation.
The project uses technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, and integrates APIs like Google Maps and HERE Traffic.
